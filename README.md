# Polycreate
 Graphical language for the Webots Create robot

## Events and states approach

Our language works with states and events: States are sets of instructions which are running indefinitely, and they can be interrupted by events. Of course, the events can trigger

## State of the project

The project has not been tested and will most likely not work with webots, because the synchronization with the robot is yet to be implemented (we lacked time). Otherwise, everything else is functional and the integration with webots itself works fine.

## Features

The intended features are the use of the gps to enable the robot to return back to its starting location, and detect and grab objects.
